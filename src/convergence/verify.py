"""Verify stage — fold verification outcomes back into ConvergenceRecords (wq-007).

A ConvergenceRecord starts unverified with a prior confidence. Verification updates
that record from what actually happened — a test/benchmark result, or a Kalman
surprise (NIS) reading from the SurpriseMonitor. This closes Reason → Act → Verify:
claims are graded by evidence, not left at their prior.

- A passing test boosts confidence toward 1.0; a failing test collapses it.
- A high NIS (a "spook" — observation contradicts the model) collapses confidence;
  a consistent NIS nudges it up.

## G9 (#764) — deterministic-reverification ratchet, closed

`verify_with_test(passed=True)` boosts confidence multiplicatively, so *replaying
the same passing test* would ratchet it 0.3 → 0.65 → 0.83 → … → 1.0 with no new
evidence — a red-team path to a fluent-but-unsourced fixed point. Each fold is now
keyed on ``(record_id, evidence_hash)``: the record remembers which evidence it has
already absorbed (``ConvergenceRecord.applied_evidence``), and re-folding identical
evidence is an idempotent no-op. Independent corroborations still count — they carry
distinct evidence, so callers that want a genuinely new fold pass a distinct
``evidence_key`` (or vary the inputs the default key is derived from).

Links to src/cio_sde/surprise.py via its `SurpriseMonitor.evaluate()` output shape
(reads "nis"/"dof"); does not modify that module.
